    "## 🚀 Beginner Set Exercises (Fundamentals)\n",
    "\n",
    "These focus on creation, adding/removing items, and understanding the unique nature of sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Set Creation and Duplicates:**\n",
    "    * Create a set called `colors` with the following values: `\"red\", \"blue\", \"green\", \"red\", \"yellow\"`.\n",
    "    * Print the set. What happened to the duplicate value?\n",
    "    * Print the **length** of the resulting set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Adding and Removing:**\n",
    "    * Start with the set `prime_numbers = {2, 3, 5, 7}`.\n",
    "    * Use the **`add()`** method to include the number `11`.\n",
    "    * Use the **`remove()`** method to take out the number `2`.\n",
    "    * Print the final set.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Safe Removal (`discard` vs. `remove`):**\n",
    "    * Start with `letters = {\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"}`.\n",
    "    * Use **`discard()`** to try and remove `\"D\"`. What happens?\n",
    "    * Now, use **`remove()`** to try and remove `\"E\"`. What happens, and what error is raised? (This demonstrates the difference between the two methods).\n",

    "## 🛠️ Intermediate Set Exercises (Logic and Operations)\n",
    "\n",
    "These exercises involve using sets for filtering and performing mathematical set operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **List to Set Conversion (Filtering Unique Values):**\n",
    "    * Given the list of user IDs: `all_ids = [101, 105, 102, 105, 103, 101, 104]`.\n",
    "    * Convert the list into a set called `unique_ids` to automatically filter out duplicates.\n",
    "    * Convert `unique_ids` back into a list and print it.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Set Intersection (Common Elements):**\n",
    "    * Define two sets:\n",
    "        * `class_a = {\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\", \"David\"}`\n",
    "        * `class_b = {\"Charlie\", \"Ethan, \"Fiona\", \"David\"}`\n",
    "    * Use the **`intersection()`** method or the **`&`** operator to find and print the names of students who are in **both** classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Set Difference (Unique Elements):**\n",
    "    * Using `class_a` and `class_b` from the previous exercise, find the names of students who are in **`class_a` but NOT in `class_b`**.\n",
    "    * Use the **`difference()`** method or the **`-`** operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Expert Set Exercises (Advanced Methods and Frozenset)\n",
    "\n",
    "These exercises focus on more complex set methods and the concept of immutability.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Symmetric Difference (Exclusive Elements):**\n",
    "    * Define two sets: `set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` and `set2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}`.\n",
    "    * Use the **`symmetric_difference()`** method or the **`^`** operator to find and print all numbers that are present in **either** set, but **not** in both (the non-common elements).\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  **Subset and Superset Check:**\n",
    "    * Define three sets:\n",
    "        * `large_set = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}`\n",
    "        * `small_set_a = {10, 30}`\n",
    "        * `small_set_b = {10, 60}`\n",
    "    * Use **`issubset()`** to check if `small_set_a` is a subset of `large_set`.\n",
    "    * Use **`issuperset()`** to check if `large_set` is a superset of `small_set_b`. Print the Boolean results.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.  **Frozenset and Dictionary Keys:**\n",
    "    * **Frozensets** are hashable, meaning they can be used as **dictionary keys**.\n",
    "    * Create a standard set `unhashable_set = {1, 2}`. Try to use it as a key in a dictionary (it will fail).\n",
    "    * Convert `unhashable_set` into a **`frozenset`** called `hashable_set`.\n",
    "    * Now, use `hashable_set` as the key in a dictionary where the value is `\"Locked\"`.\n",
    "    * Print the dictionary to show the frozenset being used as a key.\n",
