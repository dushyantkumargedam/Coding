    "## 🚀 Beginner Exercises (Basic Conditionals)\n",
    "\n",
    "These focus on using `if`, `else`, and simple comparison operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Simple Pass/Fail Check:**\n",
    "    * Create a variable `score` and set it to a number (e.g., `65`).\n",
    "    * Write an `if` statement that checks if the score is greater than or equal to `70`.\n",
    "    * If `True`, print: \"Passed the test.\"\n",
    "    * Otherwise (using `else`), print: \"Failed the test.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Even or Odd:**\n",
    "    * Create a variable `number` and set it to an integer (e.g., `9`).\n",
    "    * Write an `if` statement that uses the **Modulus Operator (`%`)** to check if the number is even (remainder is 0 when divided by 2).\n",
    "    * Print whether the number is \"Even\" or \"Odd\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Short-Hand If-Else:**\n",
    "    * Create two variables, `a = 15` and `b = 20`.\n",
    "    * Use the **short-hand `if-else`** syntax to assign the value \"B is Larger\" to a variable called `result` if `b` is greater than `a`, otherwise assign \"A is Larger or Equal\".\n",
    "    * Print `result`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ Intermediate Exercises (Elif and Logical Operators)\n",
    "\n",
    "These exercises require using the `elif` keyword and combining conditions with `and`, `or`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Grade Calculator (If-Elif-Else Chain):**\n",
    "    * Create a variable `points` and set it to a value (e.g., `88`).\n",
    "    * Write a complete `if-elif-else` chain to determine and print the letter grade:\n",
    "        * `90` or above: \"A\"\n",
    "        * `80` to `89`: \"B\"\n",
    "        * `70` to `79`: \"C\"\n",
    "        * `60` to `69`: \"D\"\n",
    "        * Below `60`: \"F\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Vacation Day Planner (`and` operator):**\n",
    "    * Create variables `temperature = 28` and `is_raining = False`.\n",
    "    * Write an `if` statement that uses the **`and`** operator to check **two conditions**:\n",
    "        1.  The `temperature` is greater than `25`.\n",
    "        2.  `is_raining` is `False`.\n",
    "    * If both are `True`, print: \"Perfect weather for the beach!\" Otherwise, print: \"Stay inside.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Weekend Check (`or` operator):**\n",
    "    * Create a variable `day = \"Sunday\"`.\n",
    "    * Write an `if` statement that uses the **`or`** operator to check if the `day` is \"Saturday\" **or** \"Sunday\".\n",
    "    * Print \"It's the weekend!\" or \"Back to work.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Expert Exercises (Nesting, Multiple Logic, and `pass`)\n",
    "\n",
    "These exercises involve nesting, using `not`, and applying advanced flow control.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Ticket Price Logic (`and` and `not`):**\n",
    "    * Create variables: `age = 17`, `is_student = True`.\n",
    "    * Write an `if` statement to determine if a person qualifies for a **student discount**:\n",
    "        * The person must be **under 18** OR a **student** (or both).\n",
    "        * The person must **NOT** be 65 or older.\n",
    "    * Use parentheses to group your conditions for clarity. If the criteria are met, print: \"Eligible for Discount.\" Otherwise, print: \"Standard Price.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  **Nested Conditional Access Control:**\n",
    "    * Create variables: `is_logged_in = True`, `user_role = \"admin\"`.\n",
    "    * Use **nested `if` statements** to check the following:\n",
    "        * **Outer `if`**: Check if `is_logged_in` is `True`.\n",
    "        * **Inner `if`**: If logged in, check if `user_role` is `\"admin\"`.\n",
    "    * If both are true, print: \"Access Granted to Admin Panel.\"\n",
    "    * If logged in but **not** admin, print: \"Access Denied.\"\n",
    "    * If not logged in, print: \"Please log in first.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "9.  **Placeholder Logic (`pass` statement):**\n",
    "    * Create a variable `product_status = \"pending\"`.\n",
    "    * Write an `if-elif-else` chain to handle different statuses:\n",
    "        * If `product_status` is `\"available\"`, print: \"Ready for shipment.\"\n",
    "        * If `product_status` is `\"pending\"`, use the **`pass`** statement (code to be written later).\n",
    "        * If `product_status` is `\"out_of_stock\"`, print: \"Order cancelled.\"\n",
    "    * Execute the code and confirm that the \"pending\" condition results in no action.\n",
