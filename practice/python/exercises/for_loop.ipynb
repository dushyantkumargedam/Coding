    "## 🔁 Python Loop Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "These exercises will challenge your understanding of `for` loops, `while` loops, and control statements like `break` and `continue`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Beginner Exercises (Basic Iteration)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Print Numbers:**\n",
    "    * Use a **`for` loop** with the `range()` function to print all numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Countdown Timer:**\n",
    "    * Use a **`while` loop** to print a countdown starting from 5 and ending at 1. Make sure the loop condition eventually becomes `False` to prevent an infinite loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Iterate a String:**\n",
    "    * Start with `word = \"DEVELOPER\"`.\n",
    "    * Use a **`for` loop** to iterate through the string and print each letter on a new line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ Intermediate Exercises (Control Statements)\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Skip Even Numbers (`continue`):**\n",
    "    * Use a **`for` loop** that iterates through numbers from 1 to 10.\n",
    "    * Use the **`continue`** statement to **skip** the iteration if the number is even.\n",
    "    * Only print the odd numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Stop at Target (`break`):**\n",
    "    * Start with `data = [10, 20, 5, 30, 40]`.\n",
    "    * Use a **`for` loop** to iterate through the list.\n",
    "    * If the value **`5`** is encountered, print \"Target found! Stopping loop.\" and use the **`break`** statement to exit the loop immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Loop with `else`:**\n",
    "    * Use a **`for` loop** to check the list `names = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"]` for the name `\"Zoe\"`.\n",
    "    * If `\"Zoe\"` is found, use `break`.\n",
    "    * Use the **`else`** block associated with the loop to print \"Zoe was not in the list.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Expert Exercises (Nesting and Advanced Logic)\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Multiplication Table (Nested Loops):**\n",
    "    * Use **nested `for` loops** to print the multiplication table for numbers 1 through 3.\n",
    "    * *Outer loop:* Iterates for `i` from 1 to 3.\n",
    "    * *Inner loop:* Iterates for `j` from 1 to 10.\n",
    "    * Print the result of `i * j` in a formatted way (e.g., \"1 x 1 = 1\", \"1 x 2 = 2\", etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  **Input Loop with Validation:**\n",
    "    * Use a **`while True`** loop to repeatedly ask the user to enter a positive number.\n",
    "    * If the user enters a number greater than 0, print the number and use **`break`** to exit the loop.\n",
    "    * If the user enters a negative number or zero, print \"Invalid input. Please try again.\" and use **`continue`** to prompt them again.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.  **Password Guessing (Simulated):**\n",
    "    * Set a secret password: `secret = \"python123\"`.\n",
    "    * Use a **`for` loop** and the `range()` function to give the user **three attempts** to guess the password.\n",
    "    * In each iteration, ask the user for input.\n",
    "    * If the guess is correct, print \"Access Granted!\" and use **`break`**.\n",
    "    * If the loop finishes without a correct guess, use the loop's **`else`** block to print \"Access Denied. Too many attempts.\"\n",
