    "## 🚀 Beginner List Exercises (Basic Operations)\n",
    "\n",
    "These exercises focus on fundamental list creation, access, and modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **List Creation and Access:**\n",
    "    * Create a list called `planets` containing the names of the first four planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars).\n",
    "    * Print the **length** of the list.\n",
    "    * Print the planet at **index 2** (Earth).\n",
    "    * Use **negative indexing** to print the last planet (Mars).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Adding and Removing:**\n",
    "    * Start with the list `numbers = [10, 20, 30]`.\n",
    "    * Use **`append()`** to add `40` to the end.\n",
    "    * Use **`insert()`** to add `5` at the beginning (index 0).\n",
    "    * Use **`remove()`** to take out the number `30`.\n",
    "    * Print the final list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Slicing a List:**\n",
    "    * Given the list `alphabet = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']`.\n",
    "    * Create a new list called `middle` containing elements from index 2 up to, but not including, index 5 (`c`, `d`, `e`).\n",
    "    * Create a new list called `start_end` containing the first two elements and the last two elements of the list (Hint: You'll need two slices and the `+` operator).\n"

    "## 🛠️ Intermediate List Exercises (Logic and Iteration)\n",
    "\n",
    "These exercises require looping, conditional logic, and using built-in methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Find the Maximum Value:**\n",
    "    * Start with the list `scores = [85, 92, 78, 95, 88, 70]`.\n",
    "    * Loop through the list using a **`for` loop** and find the **highest score** without using the built-in `max()` function.\n",
    "    * Print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Filtering with a Loop:**\n",
    "    * Given the list `all_items = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"kiwi\", \"grape\", \"avocado\", \"orange\"]`.\n",
    "    * Create a new, empty list called `short_fruits`.\n",
    "    * Use a **`for` loop** and an **`if` statement** to iterate through `all_items` and add only the fruits with a name length of **5 or less** to `short_fruits`.\n",
    "    * Print `short_fruits`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **List Sorting and Reversal:**\n",
    "    * Start with `mixed_names = [\"Alice\", \"bob\", \"Charlie\", \"david\"]`.\n",
    "    * Sort the list **alphabetically** but make the sort **case-insensitive**.\n",
    "    * After sorting, **reverse** the order of the list.\n",
    "    * Print the final result."

    "## 🧠 Expert List Exercises (Advanced Techniques)\n",
    "\n",
    "These exercises involve list comprehension, nested lists, and efficient data manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **List Comprehension for Transformation:**\n",
    "    * Start with the list `prices = [100, 250, 45, 1200]`.\n",
    "    * Use a single-line **list comprehension** to create a new list called `discounted_prices` where every price has been reduced by **10%** (i.e., multiplied by 0.9).\n",
    "    * Print `discounted_prices`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  **Nested List Summation:**\n",
    "    * Given the nested list `data = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]`.\n",
    "    * Use **nested loops** (or a single list comprehension if you are feeling ambitious) to calculate the **sum of all numbers** within all the inner lists.\n",
    "    * Print the grand total.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.  **Removing Duplicates and Preserving Order:**\n",
    "    * Given the list `data = ['A', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'B', 'D']`.\n",
    "    * Create a new list called `unique_data` that contains only the unique items, and they must appear in the **same order** as they first appeared in the original list.\n",
    "    * *(Hint: You will need a loop and the **`in`** keyword or a specialized data structure like a dictionary/set for tracking.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **The `split()` Challenge:**\n",
    "    * Take the sentence `sentence = \"Python lists are incredibly useful for data science tasks\"`\n",
    "    * Use the **`.split()`** string method to convert the sentence into a list of words.\n",
    "    * Use a **list comprehension** to create a new list containing only the words whose **length is greater than 5**.\n",
    "    * Print the final list of long words."
