    "These focus on creation, accessing, and understanding immutability.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Creation and Access:**\n",
    "    * Create a tuple called `months` containing the names of the first three months of the year (`January`, `February`, `March`).\n",
    "    * Print the length of the tuple.\n",
    "    * Access and print the month at **index 1**.\n",
    "    * Use **negative indexing** to print the last month.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Single-Item Tuple:**\n",
    "    * Create a variable `single_item` containing the string `\"Data\"` and ensure its type is a **tuple**.\n",
    "    * Print the variable and use the **`type()`** function to prove it is a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Immutability Test:**\n",
    "    * Start with `coordinates = (10, 20)`.\n",
    "    * Attempt to change the first element to `15` using index assignment (`coordinates[0] = 15`).\n",
    "    * What kind of **error** does Python raise? (This confirms the immutable property).\n",

    "\n",
    "These exercises involve the list conversion workaround and using tuple methods.\n",

    "4.  **Tuple Modification Workaround:**\n",
    "    * Start with `my_data = (\"Alice\", 25, \"New York\")`.\n",
    "    * Use the **list conversion workaround** to change the location from `\"New York\"` to `\"London\"`.\n",
    "    * Print the final modified tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Tuple Joining:**\n",
    "    * Create two tuples: `names = (\"Alex\", \"Ben\")` and `ids = (101, 102)`.\n",
    "    * Join them using the **`+` operator** to create a single tuple called `combined_info`.\n",
    "    * Print `combined_info`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Counting and Indexing:**\n",
    "    * Given `data_points = (1, 5, 2, 5, 8, 5, 3)`.\n",
    "    * Use the **`.count()`** method to find out how many times the number `5` appears.\n",
    "    * Use the **`.index()`** method to find the index of the **first** occurrence of the number `8`.\n",
    "    * Print both results.\n",

    "## 🧠 Expert Tuple Exercises (Unpacking and Nesting)\n",
    "\n",
    "These exercises focus on unpacking and using tuples in advanced ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Basic Unpacking:**\n",
    "    * Create a tuple `rgb_color = (255, 0, 128)`.\n",
    "    * Unpack this tuple into three variables named `red`, `green`, and `blue` in a single line.\n",
    "    * Print the value of `blue`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  **Variable Assignment Unpacking (Asterisk `*`):**\n",
    "    * Given `product_details = (\"SKU001\", \"Laptop Pro\", 1200.50, 5, \"Electronics\", \"Warehouse A\")`.\n",
    "    * Unpack the details into variables such that:\n",
    "        * `sku` gets the first item.\n",
    "        * `price` gets the third item.\n",
    "        * `rest_details` gets all the remaining items using the asterisk `*`.\n",
    "    * Print the `rest_details` variable. What data type is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "9.  **Nested Tuple Access:**\n",
    "    * Given the nested tuple of records: `records = ((\"Alice\", 30), (\"Bob\", 45), (\"Charlie\", 22))`.\n",
    "    * Access and print the age of the second person (\"Bob\").\n",
    "    * Use a **`for` loop** to iterate through the `records` and print a sentence for each person, like: \"Alice is 30 years old.\"\n"
