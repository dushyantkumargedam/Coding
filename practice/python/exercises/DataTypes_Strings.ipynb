    "1.  **Type Identification:**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * Create a variable for your age, your height (with decimals), and a boolean (e.g., `is_student`).\n",
    "      * Use the **`type()`** function to print the data type of each variable.\n",
    "      * **Challenge:** What type does the result of `3 + 2j` yield?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Basic Casting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * Take the string `\"25.75\"` and convert it to a floating-point number.\n",
    "      * Take the integer `15` and convert it to a string.\n",
    "      * Take the float `5.99` and convert it to an integer. What happens to the decimal?\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **List and Tuple Differences:**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * Create a **list** of your top three favorite colors.\n",
    "      * Attempt to change the first element of the list to a new color.\n",
    "      * Create a **tuple** of the numbers (10, 20, 30).\n",
    "      * Attempt to change the first element of the tuple. What error do you get? (This demonstrates **mutability** vs. **immutability**).\n",

    "\n",

    "      * Concatenate them to form a `full_name` with a space in between.\n",
    "      * Use the **`len()`** function to find the total length of `full_name`.\n",

    "      * Given the string `s = \"Analytical\"`, use indexing to extract and print the character 'A'.\n",
    "      * Use slicing to extract and print the substring `\"lytical\"`.\n",
    "      * Use negative indexing to extract and print the character 'l' (the last letter).\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Case and Stripping:**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * Take the string `dirty_word = \"    pREscriptive   \"`.\n",
    "      * Use a chain of string methods to clean it (remove whitespace and convert all characters to lowercase) so the result is `\"prescriptive\"`.\n"

    "      * Ask the user for a country name.\n",

    "\n",
    "      * Create two sets of student IDs: `set_a = {101, 102, 103, 104}` and `set_b = {103, 104, 105, 106}`.\n",
    "      * Find the **intersection** (students in both classes) and the **union** (all unique students).\n",

    "9.  **Type-Agnostic Summation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * Write a function that accepts one argument.\n",
    "      * Use the **`type()`** function to check if the argument is a **list** or a **tuple**.\n",

    "      * Write a function that takes a list of lists (e.g., `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [1, 2]]`).\n",
    "      * Use a **set** to find and print only the unique inner lists. *Hint: Lists are unhashable, so they cannot be put directly into a set. You must **cast** the inner lists to **tuples** first.*\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Conditional List Comprehension:**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * Starting with the list `numbers = [1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]`, use a single-line **list comprehension** to create a new list containing only the numbers that are **divisible by 5**.\n"
